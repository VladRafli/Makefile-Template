<h1>Makefile Template</h1>
<p>Created by VladRafli</p>

<h2>What is Makefile?</h2>
<p>Makefile is basically a file to shorten your time to compile every source code you want to compile.</p>
<p>This method is usually used in Terminal (Linux or MacOS), but for windows users, there is nothing to worry about because the latest update of Windows 10, Linux Distribution was released for Windows, bascially a Sub-system which integrated with Windows System.</p>
<p>For non Windows 10 Users and Mac Users, you must install <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> for terminal environment</p>
